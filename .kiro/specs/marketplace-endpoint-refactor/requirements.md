# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current marketplace endpoints have inconsistent and non-RESTful URL patterns. The publish functionality is located at `/creator/publish-marketplace` while browsing is at `/marketplace/browse`. This feature will refactor the endpoints to follow REST conventions where publishing to marketplace is `POST /marketplace` and browsing marketplace is `GET /marketplace`, making the API more intuitive and consistent.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want marketplace endpoints to follow REST conventions, so that the API is intuitive and follows standard HTTP method semantics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to publish to marketplace THEN they SHALL use `POST /marketplace` endpoint
2. WHEN a user wants to browse marketplace THEN they SHALL use `GET /marketplace` endpoint  
3. WHEN the endpoints are refactored THEN they SHALL maintain the same request/response format as current endpoints
4. WHEN the new endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL preserve all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the marketplace controller to be the single source of truth for marketplace operations, so that related functionality is properly organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN marketplace endpoints are refactored THEN the publish functionality SHALL be moved from creator controller to marketplace controller
2. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all marketplace-related endpoints SHALL be under the `/marketplace` path
3. WHEN endpoints are moved THEN proper authentication and authorization SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the creator controller SHALL no longer contain marketplace publishing logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want backward compatibility during the transition period, so that existing integrations continue to work while I update to the new endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new endpoints are deployed THEN the old endpoints SHALL remain functional with deprecation warnings
2. WHEN old endpoints are called THEN they SHALL log deprecation warnings for monitoring
3. WHEN deprecation period ends THEN old endpoints SHALL return proper HTTP status codes indicating they are no longer available
4. WHEN new endpoints are documented THEN they SHALL include migration guidance from old endpoints
