# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web3 NFT minting functionality is currently failing with "Invalid transaction hash format" errors when users attempt to mint designs from chat. The system needs robust transaction hash validation that can handle various blockchain transaction hash formats while maintaining security and preventing invalid data from being processed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mint NFT designs from chat conversations so that I can create unique digital assets from my AI-generated designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid transaction hash for payment THEN the system SHALL accept the hash and proceed with minting
2. WHEN a user provides an invalid transaction hash THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message explaining the validation requirements
3. WHEN the system validates a transaction hash THEN it SHALL support multiple blockchain formats (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive transaction hash validation so that the system can handle different blockchain networks and transaction formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating Ethereum transaction hashes THEN the system SHALL accept hashes that start with '0x' and are 66 characters long
2. WHEN validating Polygon transaction hashes THEN the system SHALL accept hashes that start with '0x' and are 66 characters long
3. WHEN validating transaction hashes THEN the system SHALL reject empty, null, or undefined values
4. WHEN validating transaction hashes THEN the system SHALL reject hashes with invalid hexadecimal characters
5. WHEN validating transaction hashes THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages for different validation failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for transaction validation so that I can troubleshoot payment issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction hash validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific validation error with context
2. WHEN transaction hash validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the successful validation
3. WHEN payment verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages to users
4. WHEN the system encounters blockchain connectivity issues THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to verify my payment transaction before minting so that I can be confident my payment was processed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction hash is provided THEN the system SHALL verify the transaction exists on the blockchain
2. WHEN verifying a transaction THEN the system SHALL check that the payment amount matches the minting fee
3. WHEN verifying a transaction THEN the system SHALL check that the transaction was successful (not reverted)
4. IF payment verification fails THEN the system SHALL not proceed with minting and SHALL provide clear feedback
