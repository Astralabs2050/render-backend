# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add service method for getting inventory by ID
  - Extend DesignService with getInventoryById method that queries NFT by ID and creatorId
  - Implement proper error handling and logging consistent with existing methods
  - Return CreateDesignInventoryDto or null for not found cases
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Add controller endpoint for inventory by ID
  - Add GET /creator/inventory/:id endpoint to CreatorController
  - Use ParseUUIDPipe for ID validation and existing guards for authentication
  - Implement ownership validation to ensure design belongs to authenticated creator
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Implement proper error responses and validation
  - Add error handling for invalid UUID format (400), not found (404), and unauthorized access (403)
  - Ensure consistent error response format matching existing endpoints
  - Add appropriate HTTP status codes for each error scenario
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive unit tests for service method
  - Write tests for successful retrieval with valid ID and creatorId
  - Test error handling for database failures and not found scenarios
  - Verify data transformation and field mapping accuracy
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive unit tests for controller endpoint
  - Test successful endpoint execution with proper authentication and ownership
  - Test UUID validation, authentication failures, and ownership validation
  - Verify error response formats and HTTP status codes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.1, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Add integration tests for complete endpoint functionality
  - Create end-to-end tests covering authentication, authorization, and data retrieval
  - Test with real database interactions and verify response format consistency
  - Validate security measures and proper error handling in realistic scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 4.4, 4.5_
