# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a new API endpoint that allows creators to retrieve detailed information about a specific design in their inventory by providing the design ID. This complements the existing inventory list endpoint by providing focused access to individual inventory items with all necessary fields for detailed views and operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a creator, I want to retrieve detailed information about a specific design in my inventory by its ID, so that I can view complete details for a single design without fetching my entire inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator makes a GET request to `/creator/inventory/:id` with a valid design ID THEN the system SHALL return the design details with status 200
2. WHEN the requested design ID exists and belongs to the authenticated creator THEN the system SHALL return the design with all required fields (id, name, price, quantity, status, imageUrl, lastUpdated)
3. WHEN the requested design ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
4. WHEN the requested design ID exists but does not belong to the authenticated creator THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error with appropriate message
5. WHEN an unauthenticated user makes the request THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a creator, I want the inventory by ID endpoint to return consistent field names and data types, so that I can reliably integrate it with my frontend applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the endpoint returns design data THEN the response SHALL include the following fields: id (string), name (string), price (number), quantity (number), status (enum), imageUrl (string), lastUpdated (Date)
2. WHEN the endpoint returns design data THEN the field names SHALL match the existing inventory list endpoint for consistency
3. WHEN the endpoint returns design data THEN the response SHALL follow the standard API response format with status, message, and data properties
4. WHEN the design has a null or undefined price THEN the system SHALL return 0 as the default price value
5. WHEN the design has a null or undefined quantity THEN the system SHALL return 0 as the default quantity value

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a creator, I want proper error handling and validation for the inventory by ID endpoint, so that I receive clear feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid UUID format is provided as the design ID THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with validation message
2. WHEN the database query fails THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error with appropriate error message
3. WHEN the endpoint encounters any error THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the response SHALL follow the standard error response format
5. WHEN the creator role validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error indicating insufficient permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the inventory by ID endpoint to be properly secured and follow existing authentication patterns, so that it maintains consistency with other creator endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL require JWT authentication using the existing JwtAuthGuard
2. WHEN the endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL require CREATOR role using the existing RoleGuard
3. WHEN the endpoint validates ownership THEN the system SHALL ensure the design belongs to the authenticated creator
4. WHEN the endpoint processes the request THEN the system SHALL use the existing DesignService methods where possible
5. WHEN the endpoint is defined THEN it SHALL be placed in the existing CreatorController following established patterns
